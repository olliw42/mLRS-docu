# mLRS Documentation: SeeedStudio Wio-E5 Boards #

([back to main page](../README.md))

The SeeedStudio [Wio-E5 module](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/LoRa-E5_STM32WLE5JC_Module) is a highly attractive module for building mLRS equipment. SeeedStudio provides a number of boards which are based on this module, and which are quite interesting hardware for mLRS. However, these boards are not perfect since their pins are not ready-made for the purposes of mLRS. So, some tweaking and (easy) soldering is required.

## SeeedStudio Wio-E5 Mini dev Board ##

- [Product Page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/LoRa_E5_mini/)
- [3D Model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6108814)

This board is well suited for building a Tx mLRS module, and - if the somewhat larger weight and size is no concern - also for building a Rx module.

### As Tx Module ###

Connections (name in respect to board print-ons):

- serial: Tx2,Rx2
- in: Rx1
- com/cli: Tx,Rx and on-board USB plug
- debug: A3
- led green: SDA (solder a green LED with resistor > 300 Ohm to GND, you can use pad SCL as intermediate post)
- led red: on-board
- bind button: BOOT button, hold for 4 seconds to initiate bind mode

If you want to communicate with the radio via the JR bay (pin 5 in the JR bay), then you in addition need to do:

- solder a Schottky diode (e.g. BAT42) between pads RX1 and TX1 (RX1 - |<| - TX1, |<| represents the diode)
- use firmware with DEVICE_HAS_JRPIN5 enabled (this is the default)

Example Wiring using JR bay with CRSF:

### As Rx Module ###

Connections (name in respect to board print-ons):

- serial: Tx2,Rx2
- out: Tx1
- debug: Tx, and on-board USB plug
- led green: SDA (solder a green LED with resistor > 300 Ohm to GND, you can use pad SCL as intermediate post)
- led red: on-board
- bind button: BOOT button, hold for 4 seconds to initiate bind mode

## SeeedStudio Grove Wio-E5 Board ##

- [Product Page](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_LoRa_E5_New_Version/)

### As Tx Module ###

not recommended

### As Rx Module ###

Connections (name in respect to board print-ons):

- serial: Tx,Rx on connector, and solder pads on bottom
- out: none
- debug: none
- led green: none
- led red: on-board (solder jumper on the bottom of the board needs to be closed)
- bind button: BOOT solder pad (solder a button between the BOOT pad and GND or a wire between the two to ground out the BOOT pad, hold for 4 seconds to initiate bind mode)

Note: There is no convenient way to connect a green LED, and you thus won't get the information conveyed by it (like connection). It is possible to work around this but it would require some more sophisticated solder work.

## Flashing the Modules ##

**Important: Every time that you power a board you should ensure that there is an antenna connected otherwise you risk damaging the RF section.**

### Initial Flashing ###

The first time that you flash the mLRS firmware to either the E5 Mini or E5 Grove you'll have to do the following:

- Download and install [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)
- Connect your ST-Link to the 3V3, GND, SWD, and SWCLK pins on the board
    - The SWD and SWCLK pins are labeled 'DIO' and 'CLK' respectively
    - Some ST-Link boards provide power and some do not - ensure the E5 is powered
- Launch STM32CubeProgrammer and select ST-Link as the connection method, click connect
- From the menu on the left select the OB (Option Bytes) tile
- From the Read Out Protection section, change to AA, select Apply
    - This will erase the factory firmware
- From the menu on the left select the Download tile
- Select the correct firmware in the Download section, click Start Program
- Power cycle the board, the red LED should blink which indicates that the board is disconnected

### Subsequent Flashing ###

Subsequent flashing can be done in two ways:
1. Follow the initial flashing process
    - There is no need to change the read out protection after the initial flash
2. Boot into the system bootloader using the cli, lua or the OLED display
    - This enables programming over UART1 (PA9, PA10) or UART2 (PA2, PA3) with a USB-TTL adapter using the Serial connection option in STM32CubeProgrammer
