# mLRS Documentation: MatekSys mLRS Tx Modules & Receivers #

([back to main page](../README.md))

The MatekSys mLRS Tx modules and receivers are specifically designed for mLRS and are the best options available. If you are new to mLRS, then it is highy recommended to start with this hardware.

They are available for the 2.4 GHz band and the 868/915 MHz band. 

Note: The MatekSys mLRS gear in the 868/915 MHz band use the newer SX126x/STM32WLE chipset, and are incompatible with SX127x hardware (Frsky R9 system and ELRS 900 MHz gear)(see [here](SX126x_SX127x_INCOMPATIBILITY.md)).

## Flashing / Upgrading Firmware ##

The most convenient way of flashing the mLRS devices is via their USB-C port and using the [mLRS Web Flasher](https://mlrs.xyz/flash) app.

Plug in the USB-C cable while pressing the bind button. This puts the mLRS device into DFU mode (LEDs are not flashing). Then follow the instructions provided by the mLRS Web Flasher app.
