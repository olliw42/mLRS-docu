# mLRS Documentation: MatekSys mLRS Receivers & Tx Modules #

([back to main page](../README.md))

The MatekSys mLRS receivers and Tx modules are specifically designed for mLRS, and are currently simply the best options available. 

They are available for the 2.4 GHz band and the 868/915 MHz band. 

Note: The MatekSys mLRS gear in the 868/915 MHz band use the newer SX126x chipset, and are incompatible with SX127x hardware (Frsky R9 system and ELRS 900 MHz gear).
