# mLRS Documentation: ELRS Receivers #

([back to main page](../README.md))

Note: 868/915 MHz ELRS receivers cannot connect with 868/915 MHz mLRS Tx modules using the SX126x LoRa chipset. This is because the 868/915 MHz ELRS receivers use the SX127x LoRa chipset, which is incompatible with the SX126x LoRa chipset for the spreading factor used by the mLRS 19 Hz mode. In addition, the SX127x does not support the spreading factor which is used for the mLRS 31 Hz mode.

## Selected ELRS Receivers ##

The following receivers are good choices. They support &#8805; 100 mW, are affordable, and have been validated by the mLRS team.

| Product Name           | Frequency Band | Transmit Power  | Notes                                           |

| Bayck 915M Nano Pro    | 868/915 MHz    | 27 dBm (500 mW) | PA + LNA                                        |
| BetaFPV SuperD 2.4G    | 2.4 GHz        | 20 dBm (100 mW) | True Diversity, PA + LNA, TCXO                  |
| RadioMaster RP4TD 2.4G | 2.4 GHz        | 20 dBm (100 mW) | True Diversity, PA + LNA, TCXO, 2nd Serial Port |
| SpeedyBee Nano 2.4G    | 2.4 GHz        | 20 dBm (100 mW) | PA + LNA                                        |

## Supported ELRS Receivers ##

Additionally, the following ELRS receiver targets are also supported:

| Target              | Transmit Power   | Notes                         |

To determine if your receiver hardware is supported with one of the generic targets, go to [ELRS Targets](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/targets/blob/master/targets.json) and look up the layout file that your hardware uses.

## Connections ##

All ELRS receivers have a standardized pinout and will need to be connected to the FC as follows:

Note: In order to send RC channels over the serial connection, change the Rx Snd RcChannel parameter to 'rc override'.

## Flashing ##

- Download the firmware for your receiver.
    - The latest pre-release is found [here](https://github.com/olliw42/mLRS/tree/main/firmware/pre-release-esp).
    - The latest official release is found [here](https://github.com/olliw42/mLRS/releases).
- To prepare your receiver for flashing, you will need to connect it to a USB<>UART, follow the normal connections:
    - 5V to 5V
    - GND to GND
    - Tx to Rx
    - Rx to Tx
- When powering on the receiver you will need to have the bind button pushed down to enter into bootloader mode.
    - For receivers with a single (non-RGB) LED you can confirm the receiver is in bootloader mode if the LED is solid.
- Open a supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera, not Firefox) and navigate [here](https://esp.huhn.me/).
- Click connect and select the serial port of your USB<>UART.
- For ESP8266 based receivers:
    - Upload the .bin file for your receiver: <br> <img src="images/ESP8266_Flash.png">
    - Click program.
- For ESP32 based receivers:
    - Download the additional files needed for flashing  [here](https://github.com/olliw42/mLRS-docu/raw/esp32-flashing/docs/files/esp32_files.zip) and unpack them.
    - Create additional entries with the following offsets and files.  Note: the firmware.bin should use the 10000 offset. <br> <img src="images/ESP32_Flash.png">
    - Click program.
- Once the firmware has been written sucessfully, power cycle the receiver. The LED should blink to indicate that it is looking for a connection.
    - Note: Binding can be done by holding down the button for four seconds.
