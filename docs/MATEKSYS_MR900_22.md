Notes:
- To enter bind mode, press the bind button for ca 4 sec. Alternatively, power up the device quickly 4 times.</td>
- To enter the system bootloader for firmware upgrade, hold the boot button down during power up (not bind button!).
- The Rx1 pin has no function.


## Flashing ##

### Uart via Tx2, Rx2 Pins ###

- Download and install [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)
- Hold down the boot button while powering up
- Connect the device via a USB-TTL adapter, wired to the Tx2, Rx2 pins, to your PC
- Launch STM32CubeProgrammer and select UART as the connection method, select the correct COM port, click connect
- From the menu on the left select the Download tile
- Select the correct firmware in the Download section, click Start Program
- Power cycle the board, the red LED should blink which indicates that the board is disconnected


### ST-Link via SWD ###

- Download and install [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)
- Connect your ST-Link programmer to the 3V3, GND, SWD, and SWCLK pins on the board (images below)
    - The SWD and SWCLK pins are labeled 'SWD' and 'SWC' respectively
    - Some ST-Link programmers provide power and some do not - ensure the board is powered
- Launch STM32CubeProgrammer and select ST-Link as the connection method, click connect
- From the menu on the left select the Download tile
- Select the correct firmware in the Download section, click Start Program
- Power cycle the board, the red LED should blink which indicates that the board is disconnected
