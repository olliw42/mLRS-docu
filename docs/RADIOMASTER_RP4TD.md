# mLRS Documentation: RadioMaster RP4TD Receiver #

([back to main page](../README.md))

The RadioMaster RP4TD is a good option for a 2.4 GHz receiver as it offers true diversity, PA & LNA, dual TCXO and additional pads for RC out functionality.  Furthermore, it is able to be used as a Tx module with SiK like functionality.

Note: In order to send RC channels over the serial connection (which doesn't require an additional OUT wire), change the "Rx Snd RcChannel" parameter to 'rc override' (or 'rc channels' if possible).
